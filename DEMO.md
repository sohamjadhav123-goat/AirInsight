# VaniStream — Evaluation Demo Guide

This guide contains everything needed to spin up the system from a clean checkout and run an end-to-end evaluation demo.

---

## 1. Clean Checkout Startup

Run these commands in order from the repository root:

```bash
# 1. Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install pinned dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Ingest transcripts, run MMR deduplication, and build vector store
python ingest_pipeline.py --reindex --fast

# 4. Start the FastAPI server & Chat Web UI
uvicorn chatbot_api:app --reload --port 8000
```

Open your browser at: **[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)**

## 2. Five Verified Demo Queries

These 5 queries are verified against the indexed AIR news corpus:

### Query 1: Relative Date Search
- **Query:** `What happened yesterday?`
- **What it demonstrates:** Dynamic date anchoring (`_get_corpus_anchor()`) resolves relative date queries against the newest date in the corpus (`2024-05-02`), extracting `2024-05-01` bulletins instead of failing on the real-world calendar date.
- **Expected result:** 5 news segments retrieved from `2024-05-01`, including the India-Australia ICC T20 match victory, Gujarat semiconductor plant inauguration, RBI repo rate decision, and ISRO satellite launch.

### Query 2: Science & Technology Search
- **Query:** `Tell us about the ISRO satellite launch`
- **What it demonstrates:** Word-boundary keyword matching correctly classifies query genre as `Science & Technology` (without false-positive matching on "us").
- **Expected result:** Retrieves the ISRO earth observation satellite launch segment.

### Query 3: Defence & Security Search
- **Query:** `What are the latest defence and military updates?`
- **What it demonstrates:** Genre pre-filtering restricts the search space to `Defence & Security` in SQLite before FAISS similarity calculation.
- **Expected result:** Retrieves: *"Defence forces completed joint military exercises demonstrating multi-domain operational readiness."*

### Query 4: Politics Search
- **Query:** `What happened in politics?`
- **What it demonstrates:** Two-tier RAG filtering on `Politics`.
- **Expected result:** Retrieves: *"The Supreme Court reserved its judgment on important constitutional petitions regarding electoral reforms."*

### Query 5: Environmental & Weather Search
- **Query:** `What is the weather report?`
- **What it demonstrates:** Genre extraction mapping "weather" to `Environment`.
- **Expected result:** Retrieves: *"Heavy rainfall lashed coastal regions bringing relief from intense summer heatwaves."*

## 3. Demo Safety & Out-of-Range Handling

To demonstrate that the system **never** silently performs global search when a filter finds no results:

- **Query:** `sports news on 2099-01-01`
- **Expected result:** Explicit message stating:
  > *"No news segments found for 2099-01-01 to 2099-01-01 in genre 'Sports'. My corpus covers 2024-05-01 to 2024-05-02."*

## 4. Key Demo Features

### A. Deduplication Proof
- **Endpoint:** `GET http://localhost:8000/dedup`
- **UI Element:** View the green summary badge in the UI header:
  > *"Redundancy removed: 20 → 12 sentences, 40.0%"*
- Click **"View deduplication examples"** in the header to expand the top 3 rejected duplicate pairs with their cosine similarity scores.

### B. Story Evolution Timeline
- **Endpoint:** `GET http://localhost:8000/timeline?q=politics`
- **UI Element:** Enter any query into the chat input and click the **"Timeline"** button.
- Displays chronological story evolution grouped by broadcast date and ordered by broadcast hour (`08:00 hrs`, `09:00 hrs`, `10:00 hrs`).

### C. Generation Mode & Health Check
- **Endpoint:** `GET http://localhost:8000/health`
- Returns:
  ```json
  {"status": "ok", "generation_mode": "FALLBACK (no API key)"}
  ```
  *(Or `"LIVE"` if `GEMINI_API_KEY` is exported).*

### D. Click-to-Play Audio Citations
- **Audio File on Disk:** `output/audio/2024-05-01/English-0800-0810-1.mp3`
- **What it demonstrates:** Proves the end-to-end provenance chain from raw radio broadcast to transcript segment and RAG citation.
- **Testing in Chat UI:**
  1. Submit query: `Tell me about the semiconductor facility in Gujarat`
  2. The response renders source chips. Citations backed by an on-disk audio file display a clickable `▶ Audio` button.
  3. Clicking `▶ Audio` activates the shared bottom audio player bar (`#audioPlayerBar`) and begins playback with track metadata:
     > *"AIR Bulletin (2024-05-01 800) (plays full bulletin — sentence-level alignment is future work)"*
  4. The button transitions to `⏸ Stop`. Clicking it or the close button (`✕`) halts playback and hides/resets the player bar.
- **Testing in Timeline UI:**
  1. Enter `semiconductor` and click **"Timeline"**.
  2. The chronological card for 08:00 hrs displays the `▶ Audio` button alongside relevance score and genre badge.
- **Streaming & HTTP Range Endpoint:**
  - **Endpoint:** `GET http://localhost:8000/audio/0`
  - Returns `200 OK` (`Content-Type: audio/mpeg`) or `206 Partial Content` with `Accept-Ranges: bytes` when scrubbing in the browser.
- **Demo Safety & Graceful Degradation:**
  - If `output/audio` is deleted or missing, the system does not crash or throw errors: `/chat` and `/timeline` seamlessly return `has_audio: false`, and audio buttons are cleanly hidden in the UI.

## 5. Architecture Defense Q&A

**Question:** *"Why is the classifier zero-shot instead of fine-tuned?"*

**Answer:**
> **"No labelled training data exists for AIR news genres; zero-shot NLI models generalise from entailment pretraining without requiring domain-specific labels."**
